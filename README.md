<h4>A list of all Google queries you made to solve it, and timestamps (just copy it from the browser history)</h4>


<h4>A list all pages you visited to solve it (just copy it from the browser history)</h4>


<h4>A list of the 3 most biggest stumbling blocks you came across and your reflection on why they were problematic (did you misunderstand something, was some of the info you found wrong, did you miss a detail, …)</h4>


<h4>A brief “every 30 min” diary as explained in the slides (this is more frequent than one would normally do, and is just meant as part of the exercise)</h4>
