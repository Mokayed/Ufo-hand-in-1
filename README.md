<h4>A list of the 3 most biggest stumbling blocks you came across and your reflection on why they were problematic (did you misunderstand something, was some of the info you found wrong, did you miss a detail, …)</h4>

<ul>
 <li>after we found the correct color of the pixel (red which is (0,16-23,0)), we did not know where to go from there. The documentation we googled after that was not very helpful </li>
  <li>we had some difficulties understanding certain parts of the assignment. One part is particular that standed out was about the "least significant bit of the red values" where we did not understand what was meant by that</li>
  <li>we mistunderstood what steganography was about at the start</li>
</ul>


<h4>A brief “every 30 min” diary as explained in the slides (this is more frequent than one would normally do, and is just meant as part of the exercise)</h4>

<ul>
 <li>first 30 minutes: reading and understanding the exercise. Downloading the image and setting up a project + github</li>
 <li>30 minutes later: we did some research in order to understand steganography and finding a java library for that </li>
 <li>we started implementing the code for steganography and the image provided.</li>
 <li>we ran into a problem, that we tried for 30 minutes to solve.</li>
 <li>we made a readme on our repository that described our process</li>
</ul>
